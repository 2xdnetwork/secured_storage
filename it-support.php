Secured Storage also offers different approaches to pen testing such as Black Box, White Box, and Grey Box for different type of testing such as Network, Web application, Wireless, Social Engineering, and Physical pen testing.</p>

                        <p>Vulnerability scanning, also commonly known as ‘vuln scan,' is an automated process of proactively identifying network, operating systems, applications, and security vulnerabilities. The scanning process includes detecting and classifying system weaknesses in networks, network equipments, servers, shared storages, and computers. In addition to identifying security holes, the vulnerability scans also determine how effective countermeasures are in case of a threat or attack.</p>
