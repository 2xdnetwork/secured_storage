                        <div class="informationmain-right-content">
                        <p>Confidential Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means and includes the terms of this Agreement and any specifications, customer lists, subscriber lists, vendor, partner or agent lists, business plans, market launch schedules, drawings, sketches, models, samples, data, computer programs, proprietary data, intellectual property, know-how, proprietary systems or related documentation, or nonpublic technical, customer, financial or business information which is furnished or disclosed by either party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) or to which the Receiving Party has access in the course of the conducting of the business and transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term Confidential Information shall not include information that (i) is publicly known at the time of its disclosure, (ii) is lawfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is published or otherwise made known to the public or to a third party without imposing an obligation of confidentiality by the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was generated independently by the Receiving Party without use or reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.</p>

                        <p>Restrictions. The Receiving Party shall not disclose any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any person, or permit any person to use, examine or reproduce Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party unless disclosure is required by a valid subpoena, court order, government, judicial or regulatory authority or applicable law (in which case, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible, notify the Disclosing Party of such request or requirement, reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party’s cost, to obtain the appropriate protective order or other remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and, in the event such protective order or remedy is not obtained or compliance with this Agreement is waived, disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed). The Receiving Party shall exercise at least the same degree of care to protect the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information which it exercises to protect the confidentiality of its own similar confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care. Nothing herein can be construed to limit any greater or longer protections afforded to trade secrets under applicable law. Neither party shall disclose, publicize or advertise in any manner the specific terms of this Agreement, including pricing, without the prior written consent of the other party.</p>

                        <p>Limited Rights of Disclosure. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, receiving party may, without the prior specific written authorization of the disclosing party, disclose and make available the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, on a confidential and restricted basis, to its employees, agents, independent contractors, and advisors who have a reasonable need-to-know or have access to such information and materials in connection with their obligations under this Agreement and the performance of the Services and who have been informed of and agreed to the confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.</p>

                        <p>Notice of Breach. The Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any theft or unauthorized disclosure, reproduction or use of any Confidential Information, or any part of such information, of which the Receiving Party has knowledge.
                        Return of Information. Upon the request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall, at its cost, return to the Disclosing Party or destroy all copies of documents, papers or other material which may contain or be derived from the Confidential Information, which are in its possession or control. The Receiving Party shall, upon request by the Disclosing Party, provide a certificate signed by the Receiving Party in form and substance satisfactory to both parties, stating that all the Confidential Information has been returned or destroyed in accordance with this Section 3.5. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, the Receiving Party may retain Confidential Information if such is legally required, but the confidentiality obligations above shall apply to any Confidential Information for as long as such is retained.</p>

                        <p>Injunctive Relief. The Receiving Party acknowledges that any violation of the provisions of this Section 3 may result in irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party, that the Disclosing Party may have no adequate remedy at law, and that the Disclosing Party shall have the right to seek equitable relief by the way of injunction to restrain such violation and to seek such further relief it may be entitled at law or in equity.
                        No Warranty. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY AND NONINFRINGEMENT.</p>

Either party may terminate this Agreement: (i) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party for a material breach by the other party if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such notice period; or (ii) immediately in the event the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors. If the Agreement is terminated, all SOWs are simultaneously terminated and Client shall, as of the date of any termination, immediately cease accessing and otherwise utilizing the applicable Services and any Secured Storage Confidential Information, Secured Storage Equipment, or other licensed technology. Upon termination by Client pursuant to this Section 5, Secured Storage shall refund Client any prepaid fees for the affected Service that was to be provided after the effective date of termination. Termination for any reason shall not relieve Client of the obligation to pay any fees accrued or due and payable to Secured Storage prior to the effective date of termination and termination for any reason other than for uncured material breach by Secured Storage shall not relieve Customer of the obligation to pay all future amounts due under all SOWs.

                        <p>Indemnification. Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other and each of its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns from and against any and all third party claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (“Claims”) arising out of, relating to, or in connection with (a) the indemnifying party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) a breach by the indemnifying party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, duties or obligations under this Agreement. The foregoing indemnity by Secured Storage will not apply (a) where Secured Storage relied upon information provided by Client and the Claim arises from such reliance; (b) where Client, despite being advised of the risk of a Claim, specifically directed Secured Storage to proceed with the action giving rise to such Claim; or (c) where Client damaged, misused or modified the Services or the Deliverables and the Claim would not have occurred but for such damage, misuse or modification.<br><br>
                        Indemnification Procedures. Each party shall notify the other promptly in writing of any Claim about which it becomes aware. The indemnifying party may designate its counsel of choice to defend such Claim at the sole expense of the indemnifying party and/or its insurer(s), so long as such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party. The indemnified party may, at its own expense, participate in the defense. In any event, (i) the indemnifying party shall keep indemnified party informed of, and shall consult with indemnified party in connection with, the progress of any investigation, defense or settlement, and (ii) indemnifying party shall not, without the indemnified party’s prior written consent (which consent will be in indemnified party’s sole and absolute discretion), settle or compromise any claim if such settlement or compromise (x) would require any admission or acknowledgment of wrongdoing or culpability by the indemnified party; (y) would, in any manner, interfere with, enjoin, or otherwise restrict any project, production or other activity of the indemnified party; or (z) provide for any non-monetary relief to any person or entity to be performed by the indemnified party.<br><br>
                        Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT IS EITHER PARTY LIABLE TO THE OTHER OR ANY AFFILIATE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER UNDER THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE. CLIENT’S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED Secured Storage’S LOST PROFITS. EACH PARTY’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO THE OTHER FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY, FROM ANY CAUSE IS LIMITED TO THE FEES PAID AND/OR PAYABLE TO Secured Storage BY CLIENT HEREUNDER DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD FOR THE SERVICE FROM WHICH THE CLAIM AROSE.</p>

                        <p>Block Time Hours: Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable SOW, the Fees consist of “Block Time Hours,” which are a pre-paid, non-refundable amount of hours to be spent on Services during a defined time period (e.g., Block Time Hours for a given month expire at the end of the month and do not roll over to the following month). Fees for the initial Block Time Hours are due upon execution of this Agreement. Secured Storage will inform Client prior to exceeding the Block Time Hours, at which time Client may purchase an additional set of Block Time Hours. If no term for expiration is explicitly set forth within the applicable SOW, Block Time Hours will expire after 90 days.<br><br>

                        Incident Response Services: Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable SOW, the Fees for Incident Response Services are incurred on a Block Time Hours basis.<br><br>

                        vCISO Services: Secured Storage’s vCISO Services are provided on a subscription basis as more particularly set forth in the applicable SOW. However, certain aspects of the vCISO Services may be limited to a set number of hours per month (e.g., slack/email/phone calls under the vCISO Core Services and organizational security risk assessments under the vCISO Core and Committed Services) beyond which Secured Storage will bill on an hourly basis at the rates set forth in the applicable SOW. With regard to such additional Services, Secured Storage’s Billable Hours Policy directly below shall apply.<br><br>

                        Billable Hours Policy: To the extent billable time is applicable to the Services performed by Secured Storage hereunder (e.g., with regard to Incident Response Services or Block Time Hours), Secured Storage bills in increments of .5 hours. Secured Storage’s invoices will be accompanied by reasonably detailed time sheets identifying the time-keeper, the task completed and the associated project(s). Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable SOW, Secured Storage does not provide time sheets with regard to subscription-based Services (e.g., the vCISO Services).<br><br>

                        Invoices. Fees for Services to be provided by Secured Storage will be billed to Client as set forth in the applicable SOW and must be paid in full within 15 days of the date of invoice. Secured Storage is authorized under this Agreement to assess a finance charge of the lesser of 1.5% per month or the highest amount allowed by law on all past due amounts. Failure to pay more than 30 days after the date of invoice shall be a material breach of this Agreement and Secured Storage shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement with no further obligations hereunder, in addition to pursuing any other remedies available to it. Client shall reimburse Secured Storage for its reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in collecting any amounts owed by Client hereunder.<br><br>

                        Invoice Disputes. To dispute an unpaid invoice, Client must, no later than the due date of the invoice, (1) notify Secured Storage of the dispute by email at billing@b2bleadbase.com and (2) pay all undisputed portions of the invoice. If Client fails to pay the undisputed portions of an invoice by the due date of the invoice, or if it fails to provide notice as required in this section, it hereby waives its right to dispute any portion of the invoice.<br><br>

                        Expense Reimbursement Policy: Client shall reimburse Secured Storage for Secured Storage’s reasonable, actual, and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the Services. Such expenses include, but are not limited to, reasonable costs incurred for air fare, lodging, ground transportation, and meals. Secured Storage’s invoices will be accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation for such expenses.</p>
